# marvel
Marvel is an API wrapper for Marvel's Comics API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swang/marvel.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swang/marvel)

This is a new version of the library where the API is a bit clearer about what you're searching for.

## v1.1 will be the last release to support node v0.10.0/v0.12.0

# install

```
npm install marvel
```

# examples

```js
var Marvel = require('marvel')

var marvel = new Marvel({ publicKey: "<pubKey>", privateKey: "<privateKey>"})

marvel.characters
  .name("Hulk")
  .get(function(err, resp) {
    if (err) { console.log("Error: ", err) }
    else { console.log(resp) }
  })
```

This finds out the event id for "Civil War" and then returns 50 characters that were in the event (along with their thumbnail picture, if applicable)

```js
var Marvel = require('marvel')

var marvel = new Marvel({ publicKey: "<pubKey>", privateKey: "<privateKey>"})

marvel.events
  .name("civil war")
  .get(function(err, res) {
    if (err) { throw err }
    var eventId = res[0].id

    marvel.characters
      .events(eventId)
      .limit(50)
      .get(function(err, res) {
        if (err) { throw err }
        res.forEach(function(chr) {
          console.log(chr.name + " " + (!!chr.thumbnail ? (chr.thumbnail.path + "." + chr.thumbnail.extension) : ""))
        })
      })
  })
```
